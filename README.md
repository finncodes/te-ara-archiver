# te-ara-archiver

The Te Ara Archiver is a Python 3 script that scrapes Te Ara (The Encyclopedia of Aotearoa New Zealand) for their printable articles, saves them as PDFs and then a shell script archives them into tarballs with no compression or extra options applied, for easy reading in future scenarios.
